TYPES OF CIPHER:

CAESER CIPHER: Each letter in the plain text will be replaced by 3 letters down.
		eg: AKHIL -> DNKLO

MONOALPHABETIC CIPHER: Each letter in the plain text is randomly replaced by any letter other than the same letter.
			eg: A be replaced by B-Z; C be replaced by A,B or D-Z

HOMOPHONIC SUBSTITUTION CIPHER: Each alphabet in the English alphabet can have either multiple values or single values assigned to it. This forms
				the key.
				eg: A:x, y, c; B:C; X:E, g, k;
				    here, we can choose (x, y or c) to represent A in the plain text.

POLYGRAM SUBSTITUTION CIPHER: Instead of each letter in the plain text, blocks of letter will be replaced with other blocks of letters from the
				plain text.
				eg: If EDUCBA is the plain text, EDU can be replaced with LOD, or the whole of EDUCBA can be replaced with XYQLAB

POLYALPHABETICAL SUBSTITUTION CIPHER (VIGENERE CIPHER): First a table is made with 26X26 dimensions. The columns and rows are named with the 
							alphabets in order, left-right and top-bottom. Then, each cell is filled with the alphabets
							in order starting from 'A' in the first row. Then start from 'B' till the end and ends with
							'A' in the second row. Next row starts with 'C' and the same continues till the end in a 
							cyclic manner.
						PROCESS: 1)A key word is given. 
							 2)Take the corresponding letters from the plain text and the key word and find the cell 
							   coordinating to that. 
							 3)The alphabet in that cell is the encryption letter for that letter 
							   in the plain text.

KASISKI ANALYSIS FOR VIGENERE CIPHER: To break the encryption code: Check in the encrypted text where a patern is repeating.
				      Find the distance between the repeating blocks.
				      Take the factors of the distance. The key used could be one of the factors of that distance. 
				      

PLAYFAIR CIPHER: 1)Form a 5X5 matrix. Fill the initial cells with the letters of the plain text omitting the duplicate letters. Fill the rest of the 
		   cells with the rest of the english alphabets other than whats already filled (except 'J').
		 2)Group the letters in the plain text in pairs of 2. If the # is odd, add 'z' or 'a' at the end of the last standing letter.
		 3)Follow these rules:
			i)If any one of the pairs are in the same column, take the letters below each.
			ii)If any one of the pairs are in the same row, take the letters to the right to each.
			iii)If no pairs are in the same column or row, form a rectangle with the required cells as the corners and take the 
			    horizontally farthest cell within that rectangle.

HILL CIPHER: 1)Take the #of letters in the given plain text as 'n'.
	     2)Form a nxn square matrix.
	     3)Fill the matrix with the numerical values - 1 of the letters of the "key" given.
		eg: is plaintext = "ACT" and key = "GYBNQKURP";
		    n=3;
		    Matrix = 16(G) 24(Y) 1(B)
			     13(N) 16(Q) 10(K)
			     20(U) 17(R) 15(P)
	     4)Also form nx1 vector of the plaintext:
		eg: 0(A)
		    2(C)
		    19(T)
	     5)The encrypted vector is as follows:
		16 24 1   0         67          15 
		13 16 10  2    =    222    =    14 (mod 26)
		20 17 15  19        319         7
	     6)Thus the encrypted letter would be the alphabetical values of the 26 modulo of the product of the matrices.

AFFINE CIPHER: 1)Get values 'a' and 'b' variable from question.
	       2)Substitute 'a' and 'b' in equation:
			E(x) = (ax + b) mod 26
	       3)Find E(x) for each letter in the plain text for their corresponding numerical value starting with 'A' = 0.
		eg: If a = 5 and b = 7
		    for plain text = "def" = 3, 4, 5
		    E(3) = (5x3+7)mod26 = 22 = w
		    E(4) = (5x4+7)mod26 = 1  = b
		    E(5) = (5x5+7)mod26 = 6  = g
		    Therefore, encrypted text for 'def' is 'wbg'

MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSE: ax = 1(mod m); here 'x' is the MODULAR MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSE.

FERMAT'S LITTLE THEOREM: states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number (a^p – a) is an integer multiple of p.
			 ie, a^p = a(mod p)
		    	 If 'a' is not divisible by 'p', then: a^(p-1) = 1(mod p)
