IP addr has 4 bytes (32 bit).
DEF: DNS (Domain Name System): Translated Hostname to IP addrs.
DNS protocol run over UDP and uses port 53.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS services:
[1]Hostname to IP adds translation:(method)	
   1. The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application. 
   2. The browser extracts the hostname, www.someschool.edu, from the URL
      and passes the hostname to the client side of the DNS application. 
   3. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server. 
   4. The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP addr 
      for the hostname. 
   5. Once the browser receives the IPaddress from DNS, it can initiate a 
      TCPconnection to the HTTPserver process located at port 80 at that IP addrs.
[2]Host aliasing: 
	-> long Hostnames can have multiple shorter alias names.
	-> The original long name is called "Canonical hostname".
	-> DNS can be invoked to get the Canonical hostname from the alias 
	   name.
[3]Mail server aliasing:
	-> Providing alias names for mail hostname.
	-> According to MX records, a company can have the same web server 
	   and mail server alias names.
[4]Load Distribution:
	-> One hostname can have multiple IP addrs for multiple servers.
	-> eg: cnn.com can have multiple servers, each having their own 
	   IP addrs.
	-> When a client requests a hostname, a list of IP addrs is 
	   produced of all the server, then redirected to the specific 
	   IP addr.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Q)Problems with Centralized DNS server?
(A)Has 4 problems:
   -> If one DNS server crashes, whole network crashes.
   -> Traffic to single DNS server, difficult to handle.
   -> Places farther from DNS server will experience slower/inconsistent
      speeds and connections.
   -> Will have to keep update/record of all new comming DNS hosts.

Types of DNS servers:
1) Root DNS servers.
2) Top-level domain (TLD) servers.
3) Authoritative DNS servers.
